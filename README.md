# 3D-Model-Portfolio
Notes and assets in 3D model creation and modification for games

## Texturing and UV-mapping
![1][]

Low resolution textures are replaced with new textures in higher resolutions for higher quality rendering.

## Modifiers, sculpting and Weight painting
![2][]

Assets are modified using a combination of modifiers such as mirror or sculpt tools such as elastic deform to have similar topology to game assets
Then weight painting is applied to vertex groups if topology is similar such as an arm.
